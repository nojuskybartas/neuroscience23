Figures are started with a Matplotlib figure handle: \"fig_Q2A, ax = plt.subplots;\". This indicates that a link (called handle) to your figure will be saved in the variable, so we can easily check it when checking your scripts. Whenever a naming convention for a variable is given, use it, because it will allow semi-automatic grading of your project script."
